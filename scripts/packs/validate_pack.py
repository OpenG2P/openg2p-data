"""Check that a directory is a valid country pack.

    python validate_pack.py ../../packs/ETH ../../packs/XKM

Exits non-zero on the first pack that fails, so this works as a CI gate and as a
pre-commit check after regenerating a pack.

Why this exists
---------------
A pack is a contract between three things that never run together: a generator
(fetch_country_pack.py or generate_synthetic_pack.py) writes it, MDS's
load_geo_pack.py seeds a database from it, and the Evidence map surface draws it.
A pack that is subtly wrong does not fail loudly — it seeds a hierarchy with
orphans, or draws a choropleth with holes in it, and the damage surfaces days
later as figures that do not add up.

The checks below are the ones that have actually caught bugs:

  - children escaping their parent. The first synthetic boundary generator inset
    each child at *render* time rather than at assignment, so every single child
    at every level poked outside its parent. Drill-down looked fine until you
    zoomed in.
  - geometry and hierarchy disagreeing. A unit with no polygon vanishes from the
    map while still counting in the totals, so the map and the KPI above it tell
    different stories.
  - non-hierarchical P-codes. The whole reason for using P-codes as identifiers
    is that a child's code contains its parent's; code that relies on that
    breaks silently when it stops being true.
  - unit_counts drifting from reality after a hand edit.

Checks are grouped as errors (the pack is unusable) and warnings (the pack works
but something is off).

    then each is confirmed to be inside the child before it is used.

    Ababa, its vertex mean falls in the hole, and every point drawn towards that
